Hello friends, 
I've finally finished writing my own marketplace for Monero for general use!

Our project desperately needs donations.
Please support us for further development and the project's marketplace's functionality!

Features

Any user can register and purchase products on the marketplace, but to create a listing, you must have seller account status. There are two ways to become a seller. You can apply and receive it for free after the administrator reviews your request, or you can pay for it (the amount is set in the admin panel).

Autofill

The autofill system is designed for users who sell multiple products. They can fill in a field where each line represents one item for sale. If an item is autofilled, the shipping status is skipped when the user purchases the item, and they automatically receive the amount listed in the first line.

Messaging System

Users can send private messages to each other.

Password Reset: Upon registration, users receive a unique mnemonic that can be used to reset their password.

Feedback

This system has two parts: a feedback score and a trust rating. The feedback rating is primarily a percentage of positive reviews, and the trust rating can be very low, low, average, or high (unproven if the user has fewer than five reviews).

Wallet System

When a user makes a deposit, a new deposit address will be generated for them each time (deposits to old addresses created by the user will still be valid). The current system requires the user to click the balance check button for the system to check if they have any balance to add to their account (note that this system can be modified so that the server automatically checks every minute, but this can be an intensive task that needs to be run every minute if you have many users).

Escrow

When a user purchases any item, a fee (which can be configured) and automatic escrow are charged. If the seller fails to deliver the item or the item is not as advertised, the buyer can open a dispute. Both users and the administrator have access to the dispute discussion (you'll see an example where one user is actually an administrator, so they can respond as either the disputing party or the administrator).

News

Basically, a blog that appears on the front page. You can use it if you want to keep your users informed.

Auction System

Products can be sold either normally or at auction. You can specify the end date, minimum bid, and buyout price. After that, the process is automatic. The system automatically updates the minimum bid (assuming users actually bid on the product, of course), and when the auction end date is reached and no one has bought it (buyout), the user with the highest bid will become the auction winner, and all other users will be returned.

Admin Panel

In the admin panel, you can create categories, respond to supplier requests, disputes, or create news.
